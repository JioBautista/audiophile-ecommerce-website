# Audiophile E-Commerce Website

An e-commerce website with cart functionality & a checkout process.

**Link to project:** https://audiophile-ecommerce-jio.vercel.app/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, React, Tailwind, ExpressJs

For the client side my choice of tools are React bundled by Vite and Tailwind. I also used tools like React-Query for data fetching/caching, animate.css for animations, react-router-dom for navigaitons and Zustand for state-management.

For server side my first choice was Python using Django framework but the thought of juggling two programming languages were overwhelming for me so I made the choice of using ExpressJs. The libraries I used are cors, dotenv, nodemon and pg for database interactions.

## Lessons Learned:

## Front-End

**Cart Functionality**

- How to use sessionStorage
- Managing and updating state throughout the entire process

**CSS Styling**

- How to implement an overlay when the mobile menu is out
- Learned how to make background images using tailwind class utilities by configuring the settings in the tailwind.config.js
- Learned how to use variables to apply styles on elements using the spread operator

**Navigation using React-Router**

- Learned how navigation works on websites
- Better understanding of layouts

**React-Query**

- Learned how data caching works by using the Network tab on Chrome Dev Tools.

## Back-End

**Express Js**

- By reading the docs I learned how Routes work
- Read the docs about CORS
- Environmental variables
- Interacting with the database using the pg library
- Learned making queries using SQL

##Looking Forward
I plan to learn more about how login/signup system works, understanding authorizations, dive deeper when it comes to caching, sending notifications to customers from the backend and many more.
